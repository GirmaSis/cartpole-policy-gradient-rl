# Advanced Policy Gradient RL for CartPole

This repository contains implementations of **Actor-Critic** and **REINFORCE with Baseline** reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the **CartPole-v1** environment using PyTorch. The project demonstrates advanced **policy optimization techniques** and provides **visual analysis** of training performance.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Implement and compare **Actor-Critic** and **REINFORCE with Baseline** for **policy gradient reinforcement learning**.
- Train an agent to **balance a pole** on a moving cart efficiently.
- Optimize **policy learning stability** through **advantage estimation and baseline functions**.
- **Analyze performance** using training reward curves and **visualize training progress with GIFs**.

## 🏆 Why This Project is Unique
- **📈 Two core RL algorithms in one** → Learn **Actor-Critic vs. REINFORCE with Baseline**.
- **⚡ Stability improvements** → Uses **advantage estimation** and a **learned baseline** to reduce variance.
- **🔍 Efficient policy optimization** → Applies **LeakyReLU, Dropout**, and **Adaptive Learning Strategies**.
- **📊 Performance Tracking** → Plots **reward curves** and saves **GIFs of training episodes**.
